# MEGAPwLock
The best Password Locker web-based

MEGAPwLock was made by Davide Ramondetti and it is a very strong password locker for web pages and it's lock any type of attacks. 

# How it's work?
First, MEGAPwLock redirect the user to my website on a specified page and it check if the user is a bot, then it will be redirected back on the login page. Next the user must put the correct password in 3 tries, if the tries fails the user will be take he/she to a lock page and it can't login for about 24 hours. Then I must recheck.
